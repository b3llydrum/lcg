# Linear Congruential Generator #

This pseudorandom number generator will return a random number from 0 to 9.

It picks two hardcoded yet arbitrary values from a discrete stream of time and uses them to create a unique system by which to choose a number from 0 to 9.

I got this idea when I stumbled across the LCG Wikipedia page and learned about the LCG.
